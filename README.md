# godot-stylized-shaders-plugin

This is a **Godot 4.4 plugin** made with *GDExtension C++* as part of a *university project*. This plugin aims to provide a variety of **stylized shaders** that the user can customize to their liking, being able to **layer/stack** the shaders and **change the order of appliance** (to change the overall look).

# Disclaimer

This plugin is actively being worked on!!! (development started from the 8th of September 2025 and is supposed to end around the 30th of October 2025)
Please ignore this repository at least until I actually make a release, thank you ðŸ˜…

More to come later...
